# StockVisualizationProject
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between stock prices and social media activity using real-world datasets. By combining historical stock prices, sentiment data from social media posts, and aggregated metrics, we aim to uncover trends and correlations that could shed light on market behaviors.
